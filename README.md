## Component Diagram

### Description
The component diagram showcases the overall structure of the gamified chat application. It highlights the main components:
- **Streamlit UI**: The frontend user interface where users interact with the system.
- **FastAPI Backend**: The backend responsible for handling API requests, business logic, and database interactions.
- **Database**: The persistent storage for user data and pot information.

### Key Features
- Authentication Service for registration and login.
- Currency Management for tracking user balances and deducting currency.
- Messaging Service for dynamic pricing and randomized win logic.
- Pot Management for handling contributions and resets.

## Sequence Diagram

### Description
The sequence diagram describes the flow of events when a user sends a message. It visualizes interactions between the user, the Streamlit UI, the FastAPI backend, and the database.

### Key Features
- The user initiates the action by clicking "Send Message."
- The backend processes the message, updates the database, and determines whether the user wins the pot.
- The result is returned to the user via the UI.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### Description
The ERD provides a detailed view of the database schema. It defines the relationships between tables:
- **Users Table**: Stores user information, such as `id`, `username`, `balance`, and `message_count`.
- **Pot Table**: Tracks the current amount in the centralized pot.

### Key Features
- The `users` table is related to the `pot` table via contributions.
- Supports operations like balance deduction, pot contributions, and pot resets.

## Deployment Diagram

### Description
The deployment diagram illustrates the setup of the application in a real-world environment. It shows how the frontend, backend, and database components are deployed and interact.

### Key Features
- The **Streamlit UI** runs on the userâ€™s device and communicates with the backend.
- The **FastAPI Backend** is hosted on a server, handling all API requests and connecting to the database.
- The **Database** is a centralized data store accessible by the backend.
